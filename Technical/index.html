            I was born and raised in Newport Rhode Island USA, I am of Guatemalan descent. I am the second oldest of five which consist of two brothers and two sisters. From an early point of my life I learned the valuable lesson that I wanted something I was going to need to work for by my own means to get it. Whether being a material thing like a gaming console or a new bike or getting good test scores to be placed in higher classes in school. I value my upbringing in public school because I was able to see so many different ways of life and this allowed me to learn assimilation, sympathy, and compassion at a very young age. I had a huge interest in video games and computer technology which led me to building my own computer and writing my own basic games in highschool.
